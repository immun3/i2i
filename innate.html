            Innateness 
        </h2>
        <p>
            Innate immunity is our body's <i>default</i> protocol when things go wrong. <br>
            To be innate is akin to being inherent, native, even essential. <br>
            Indeed, the innate immune system can be found in almost every animal; <br>
            a testament to its foundational nature and evolutionary seniority.
