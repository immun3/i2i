primary immunodeficiency can be caused by:
    genetic mutation
    epigenetic mutation
    ...
secondary immunodeficiency can be caused by:
    exposure to external agent
    infection
    physical trauma
    ...
immunosuppressive drugs can treat/prevent graft rejection but...
    leave patient vulnerable to opportunistic infections

IgE NOT assoc. w/:
    allergy
    phylaxis*
    hypersensitivity
    histamines

Treg knockout mice most likely:
    suffer from Type II diabetes
    ...
    allergic to cheese*
    ...

TCR stimulation can MOST DIRECTLY result in:
    inactivation of autoreactive CTLs*
    production of cytotoxic granules in CTLs*
    antibody secretion
    NK cell activation

Tregs that are NOT activated towards clonal expansion by IL-2 binding:
    TR1
    Th3
    CD4+CD25+ Tregs*
    CD8+ Tregs

anergic T cells can be reactivated by:
    ...
    B7-CD28 costimulation
    Fas/FasL interaction
    ...
    none of the above*

assoc. receptors DONT have a rel. LARGE gene germline repertoire:
    B cells
    alpha-beta T cells
    ...
    gamma-delta T cells*
    NK cells*

which are false:
    twice as many CD8+ T cells than CD4+ in peripheral blood*
    twice as many CD4+ T cells than neutrophils in periph. blood*
    half as many gamma-delta T cells than alpha-beta
    half as many CD8+ T cells than CD4+ in periph. blood

whose responsibility is it to safeguard against autoimmunity?
    B cells
    T cells*
    NK cells
    ...

which TCR-CD3 complex component does NOT have assoc. ITAMs?
    zeta-zeta TCR
    alpha-beta TCR*
    gamma-epsilon CD3
    delta-epsilon CD3
